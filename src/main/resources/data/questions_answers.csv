Answer: SOA stands for Service-Oriented Architecture, which is an architectural pattern in which services are provided to the other components by application components. This pattern is used to divide a complicated software system into smaller, independent components that can communicate with each other using web-based protocols. These services can be reused, composable, and distributed over systems to create new applications."
