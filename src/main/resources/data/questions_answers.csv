Answer: Gluten sensitivity, also known as non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), is a condition that involves a person being sensitive to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Individuals with gluten sensitivity may experience symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and headaches after consuming gluten. Unlike celiac disease, there is no test or biomarker for diagnosing gluten sensitivity. Treatment for this condition typically involves following a strict gluten-free diet and avoiding wheat, barley, and rye."
